# AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: **Cristina Valerio**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Cats for Klima** is an android app that was riddle with some pretty nasty Kotlin bugs.  With those gone, it's a collection of widgets for a variety of purposes! 

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **😄🤔💡**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Pick an app screenshot to duplicate
  - Be sure to add the screenshot to "Chosen Screenshot" below.
- [x] Create a runnable app that displays an Animal Version of your chosen screenshot
- [x] Layout uses one (1) or more ConstraintLayout
- [x] Layout uses one (1) or more ImageView
- [x] Layout uses three (3) or more TextViews

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Create a custom-shape Button using Shape Drawables
- [ ] Customize the text fonts by creating new Font Resources
- [ ] Add Tooltips to your Views to help users understand how to navigate the UI
- [ ] Create a second layout, this time for an original, personal app idea

## Chosen Screenshot

I have chosen to duplicate the following layout from the **Klima** app:
